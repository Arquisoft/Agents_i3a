**Welcome to our agents module**
 
This repository contains the agents module of the team I3A2. Developed during the 2018 Software Architecture course. This module is the Agent management and queying part of the hole project. The big project consists on an incidence analysis system, composed of four modules:
 
- **[Module 1](https://github.com/Arquisoft/Loader_i3a)**: Information loader.
- **[Module 2](https://github.com/Arquisoft/Agents_i3a)**: Agent management and querying.
- **Module 3**: Incidence management.
- **Module 4**: Analysis and dashboard.

Contributions to the project are welcomed and encouraged! Please see the [Contributing guide](/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Getting Started
These instructions give the most direct path to work with the project.

### System Requirements
As the project is developed in java macOS, Windows and Linux distributions are natively supported. Of course you will need the latest JDK available. Also, depending on where are you going to run the database, you will need internet connection or MongoDB installed and running on your machine.

#### Java Development Kit (JDK)
A Java Development Kit (JDK) is a program development environment for writing Java applets and applications. It consists of a runtime environment that "sits on top" of the operating system layer as well as the tools and programming that developers need to compile, debug, and run applets and applications written in the Java programming language.

If you do not has the latest stable version download you can download it [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads).

#### MongoDB
This project uses MongoDB as the database. You can check how to use it on [MongoDB install](https://github.com/Arquisoft/participants_i2b/wiki/MongoDB). By defatult a dummy server is up and running, it´s configured at the file `applications.properties`. Change this configuration as needed, should not interfeer with the module itself.

#### Jasypt
This project uses Jasypt to encrypt the passwords. You don't need to download it as far as its dependency its imported from maven central, but you can check it [here](http://www.jasypt.org/).

### Getting Sources for Agents_i3a
First create a directory for all of the project sources:
```
mkdir agents_i3a
cd agents_i3a
```
**Cloning repository**
```
git clone https://github.com/Arquisoft/Agents_i3a.git
```

### Building Agents_i3a
As the project was created on [eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org) this is the best way to build and run the sources. The steps are the following:
1. Open Eclipse IDE.
2. Select import existing Maven Project.
3. Go to `src/main/java/main/Application.java`.
4. Right click over the class and Run as Java Application.

Up to this point the module should be up and running in the address [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

### Working with Agents_i3a

#### REST requests
In order to use the user credentials to obtain your data, you can send a POST request to [localhost:8080/user](http://localhost:8080/user). The
data in this request can come as:
##### JSON
```json
{"login":"agent-identifier", "password":"agent-password", "kind":"agent-kind-as-integer-code"}
```

##### XML
```xml
<data>
 <login>agent-identifier</login>
 <password>agent-password</password>
 <kind>agent-kind-as-integer-code</kind>
</data>
```

### Testing Agents_i3a
To run the already existing tests of the module you can choose by running as JUnit tests, from the IDE. Or as the implements Maven you can run Maven tests task as `mvn test`. If the database is up and running everything should go fine and smooth. No data in the database is needed to run them. But if you want to test the
user interface manually you'll have to introduce this document: 
```json
{
    "_id" : "58a8670df086e81dc034d7fc",
    "name" : "Clara Oswin Oswald",
    "location" : "10N10W",
    "email" : "oswald@tardis.universe",
    "kindCode" : "1",
    "id" : "45170000A",
    "password" : "khZZwjdhWwVbMdmOvz9eqBfKR1N6A+CdFBDM9c1dQduUnGewQyPRlBxB4Q6wT7Cq"
}
```

And as data use:
 - login: 45170000A
 - password: 4[[j[frVCUMJ>hU
 - Kind of agent: Person

 If you have the data and the database running and the application still reports a 404 Not Found when it shouldn't
 try deleting the document and adding it again.

As an alternative, you can perform tests on the REST service by executing the next function in the command line:

 curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"login":"45170000A","password":"4[[j[frVCUMJ>hU", "kind":1}' http://localhost:8080/user
 
 Take into account that the parameters passed in the function are the same as the previous JSON file, so they have to be synchronised.
